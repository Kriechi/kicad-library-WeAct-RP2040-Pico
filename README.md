# KiCad Footprint and Symbol for WeAct RP2040 Pico module

This repository contains KiCad 6 footprint and symbol libraries for the WeAct RP2040 Pico module (like the Raspberry Pi Pico board, but with USB-C and minor differences on used GPIO pins).

The KiCad symbol contains all alternative pin assignments so you can select which function each pin should serve.

The KiCad footprint can be linked to the 3D model: `WeAct-RP2040-Pico.step`, which is imported into this repository for convenience from the official [WeAct RP2040 repository](https://github.com/WeActTC/WeActStudio.RP2040CoreBoard).

See also official documentation of the module at: https://github.com/WeActTC/WeActStudio.RP2040CoreBoard/tree/master (see both branches!).
